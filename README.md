# Infint (Infinite Integer)
**Infinitely big integers and floating point numbers in C++**

_Turns out this already exists: [GMPLIB](https://gmplib.org/)_

### Goal

The goal of this project is to create a library for C++, which allows for easy to use integers of indefinite size. Of course there is a limit, namely RAM, but in contrast to a 64-bit integer an 8-GiByte integer is gigantic.

### Todo

- Everything; For now I only implemented a way to inititialize a value from a normal long int.
- Addition (+,+=,++)
- Subtraction (-,-=,--)
- Multiplication (\*,\*=)
- Division (/,/=)
- Logic/Bitwise (&,|,^,>>,<<)
- More complex functions (log, sin, ...)
- Floating point numbers
